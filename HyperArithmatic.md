### Some Useful Equations When Drawing Hypercubes
- [Calculating basic features](#making-tables)


## {#making-tables}
A hypercube is not a cube. A hypercube is related to a 3-cube in the same way a 3-cube is related to a square.

You may remember learning about the properties of a cube when you were in primary school. Here are a few of them:
- Polygons have corners, also called vertices. A cube has eight of them.
- Polygons have edges. A cube has twelve of them.
- Polygons have flat surfaces, also called faces. A cube has six of them.

There are other properties of a cube that we usually learn when we are a little bit older. For example:
- We can calculate the surface area of a polygon by adding the size of each size. For a cube with an edge length of $x$, the surface area is $6x^2$, because it has six sides and each has an area of $x^2$.
- We can calculate the volume of a cube with an edge length of $x$ using the equation " $x$ cubed," or $x^3$. (You can calculate the size of a square with $x$ squared. This is not an accident.)

When you are making models of hyperspace, you will eventually need to know about the properties of whatever shape you are working with. For a hypercube, you can calculate the basic properties very easily in a table.

To start with, make your table:

|dimensions in space:|vertices|edges|faces|volumes|hypervolumes|5-volumes|etc...|
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|0| | | | | | | |
|2| | | | | | | |
|3| | | | | | | |
|4| | | | | | | |
|5| | | | | | | |
|6| | | | | | | |

It is more concise and easier to read if, instead of calling the elements by the same name, you just refer to them as the dimension they represent:

| |0|1|2|3|4|5|$n$|
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|0| | | | | | | |
|2| | | | | | | |
|3| | | | | | | |
|4| | | | | | | |
|5| | | | | | | |
|6| | | | | | | |
