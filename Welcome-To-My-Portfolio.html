  <H1>Hello!</H1>
  <!--Replace with tagged vector image.-->
  <p>My name is Cat Jackson. I write, format, and communicate information. Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
  <H2>What you'll find here</H2>
  <p>This website, Ecruvian.github.io, is my personal website. I use it to practice coding, store documents that I make for fun, and publish educational pieces. Look around to see if it looks like my style fits your needs. <b>Every page and every document is made from scratch,</b> unless I credit otherwise at the top.</p>
  <!--Add a "useful resources" page-->
  <p>Most of the individual articles were originally formatted in Markdown, often using LaTex for any maths or special formulas, then modified for the web. Most of the material I write benefits from being as clean and simple as possible, but you'll also find some resources that were made just for fun. I like to make simple PNG paintings and doodles to incorporate into my online profiles and printed documents!</p>
  <!--Add a page about color theory-->
  <p>Please enjoy my articles!</p>
  <H2>Culture</H2>
  <p>Here are my top values when working in a professional setting:
    <ul>
      <li>Clear communication</li>
      <li>Casual communicaiton</li>
      <li>Openness to talking about safety and comfort</li>
      <li>Competativeness and professional success</li>
      <li>Good project management and organizationmanagement</li>
    </ul>
